# Electronic Voting Machine Prototype
Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) has become an effective tool for voting during elections. EVM is simple to use and construct, flexible and cost-effective. Manual process of voting is more time consuming and requires more manual power in order to reduce it, we are designing electronic voting machine using C programming. EVM provides faster results, cost-effective, accurate, portable, reduces the role of people and saves a lot of paper. EVM also ensures that one person can vote only once. It ensures people about their vote being secured. It avoids any malpractices and invalid votes. Here voters can save time. EVM has no more ballot papers, ballot boxes, stamping, etc.
